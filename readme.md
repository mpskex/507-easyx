# Game Proj on easyX
### Actually this project is a homework of Advanced Programming Language Designing. I would like to make it stronger and former, so I work this with a readme file that you are reading.

## First :Language
*   This Project is basically in C, cause my instructor emphasized that 
    DO NOT USE LANGUAGES WHICH IS NOT BELONG TO C.

*   This is a very simple game, and to keep its simplicity, instructor 
    insisted using easyX instead of openGL or DirectX. easyX is an simple 
    graphic library integrated by a Chinese author. Naturally, its 
    official docs are in Chinese. Like its name, it is quite simple and 
    easy to use, but it is not an effecient one. 
    Here is the website: [easyx](http://www.easyx.cn/)

## Second :Designing
*   For C is not an OOPL(Object Oriented Progaming Language), we can't 
    create real objects. But we can use ```struct``` to describe any 
    object's data. Also we used the functions with nice names, which can
    help us using C like C++.

*   Developing software with C seems not that hard, comparing with C++
    I like it very much for real, i love it and enjoy every minute with C.
    
## Third :Gaming
*   About the Game content
    *   Yes, this game is so weird and simple.-- For this game is totally a fish game. You have to eat your smaller *fellows* to survive. This game have limited time and the hardness is basic on the score you've win.(The more you win the more your enemies grow) By the way it have four difficulty options, you can chanllenge yourself to make your fish stronger!
    *   For it is just a home work, the game content is approximately settled. I don't have any update plan further, But I won't stop game-developing. I will continue my project on obj.507, though it doesn't have much progress yet... 
*   Thanks
    *   I have to thank my roommate Zhang Yitian, and Zhang Junyao to support my dev. Actually this project spends me only less than two weeks. And I really enjoy this exprience.
    *   I know this work is too simple, 'just like piece of *BEEP*', in another words. Any words are welcome, I will be very appreciated.
*   The Elements I Used in this game
    

## How To Build
*   This project is build on VS2015.  All settings is settled in ```*.sln```
    *   If you are on Windows, you can use ```git clone``` or just download it
        and unzip. Double click the ```507@easyX.sln``` to launch VS.
    *   If you are on linux, I am sorry to tell you that easyX doesn't work on
        linux.(easyx rely on GDI++) If everything settled, I will consider to 
        trans it to linux and Mac platform
