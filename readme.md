# Game Proj on easyX
### Actually this project is a homework of Advanced Programming Language Designing. I would like to make it stronger and former, so I work this with a readme file that you are reading.

## First :Language
*   This Project is basically in C, cause my instructor emphasized that 
    DO NOT USE LANGUAGES WHICH IS NOT BELONG TO C.

*   This is a very simple game, and to keep its simplicity, instructor 
    insisted using easyX instead of openGL or DirectX. easyX is an simple 
    graphic library integrated by a Chinese author. Naturally, its 
    official docs are in Chinese. Like its name, it is quite simple and 
    easy to use, but it is not an effecient one. 
    Here is the website: [easyx](http://www.easyx.cn/)

## Second :Designing
*   For C is not an OOPL(Object Oriented Progaming Language), we can't 
    create real objects. But we can use ```struct``` to describe any 
    object's data. Also we used the functions with nice names, which can
    help us using C like C++.

*   Developing software with C seems not that hard, comparing with C++
    I like it very much for real, i love it and enjoy every minute with C.
    
## Third :Gaming
*   I haven't work on the real game content yet. Please focus on this proj.

## How To Build
*   This project is build on VS2015.  All settings is settled in ```*.sln```
    *   If you are on Windows, you can use ```git clone``` or just download it
        and unzip. Double click the ```507@easyX.sln``` to launch VS.
    *   If you are on linux, I am sorry to tell you that easyX doesn't work on
        linux.(easyx rely on GDI++) If everything settled, I will consider to 
        trans it to linux and Mac platform
